## Project Overview<a name = "overview"></a> 
For this project, a web application is created which recognises digits in images. The user can upload an image or draw an digit on a canvas and the application will respond with a prediction. The key components of this project are [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). The full project specifications can be found [here](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/project.html).

Flask is a web framework. Flask provides developers with tools, libraries and technologies that allows them to build web applications.

Flask is called a Micro-framework as it has little to no dependencies with external libraries. Some examples of applications that use the Flask framework are Pinterest and LinkedIn.

For more information about flask including great tutorials click [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/).
